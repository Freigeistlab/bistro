**Winner of German Gastro Founder's Price 2018**

This system was installed at the 'Nudel Emma', a pasta bar in Überlingen Germany, where it is used every day to integrate cognitively impaired people into work life. 

Using a projector, bistro scoops with bluetooth low energy modules and an iPad at the register of the pasta bar we developed an interactive assistant that guides users through the process of pasta preparation.

Besides that a second projector displays the current ingredients on the back of the wall to give the customer feedback about the preparation process.

Also the users have access to a custom built button panel with multiple control commands like skipping an ingredient, advancing to the next recipe or clearing the current recipe queue.
