**Winner of German Gastro Founder's Price 2018**

This system was installed at the 'Nudel Emma', a pasta bar in Überlingen Germany, where it is used every day to integrate cognitively impaired people into work life. 

Using a projector, bistro scoops with bluetooth low energy modules and an iPad at the register of the pasta bar we developed an interactive assistant that guides users through the process of pasta preparation.
